Diskpoll 0.1.3, not yet released
 - Fix: Diskpoll forgot to poll mail for some AKAs if the downlink did not
   have the same number of akas as the uplink.
 - Fixed a serious bug. Diskpoll was not releasing file search handles, which
   could lead to diskpoll not "seeing" some files in the outbound. This did
   only occur on very large outbound directories. You should upgrade anyway!
 - The UNIX version now is case-tolerant, i.e. it will recognise files and
   directories no matter if they are in upper, lower or mixed case
   correctly. This enables you to access a DOS or OS/2-style outbound
   directory from a Unix machine.

Diskpoll 0.1.2, Released 17 Nov 1998
 - New: If the binkley outbound contains a reference to a file that
   does not exist, the reference is removed from the flowfile. This
   matches the behaviour that e.g. Binkley uses. (However, if the path
   in the reference does not exist as well, it is NOT removed to
   avoid removing all files fromm all flowfiles when the network path
   translation  is misconfigured or something).
 - New command line parameters: -s <flavour> and -r <flavour> specify the
   flavour of the files to send or receive. <flavour> is a string consisting
   of the letters "c", "i", "h", "d" and/or "n". If the -s and/or -r options
   are omitted, their parameters default to "?", which means "any flavour".
   These options do of course only work with a binkley outbound.
 - Fixed a bug in environment variable detection (%% was not replaced by a
   single percent character)
 - Added support for Windows NT using RSXNT.
 - Added support for DOS (DPMI required) using DJGPP.
