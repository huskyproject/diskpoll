Diskpoll 0.1.3-stable, not released yet
 - Diagnosed a bug in the OS/2 Warp 4 (without mpts/peer fixes) peer/requester
   code and provided a workound option "-w" for it. See README for more info.
 - New "-d" option to give me additional information when users report
   problems.
 - New keyword MailFlag for a system definition. It's parameter is a file 
   name of a file that will be created if the system's inbound directory has
   received any files during a diskpoll transfer session.
 - The UNIX version now is case-tolerant, i.e. it will recognise files and
   directories no matter if they are in upper, lower or mixed case
   correctly. This enables you to access a DOS or OS/2-style outbound
   directory from a Unix machine.
 - Some adaptions for Tru64 Unix (Digital Unix, OSF/1)
 - Some adaptions for older Linux header files.
 - Fixed the UNIX makefile to use g++ instead of gcc.
 - Fix: diskpoll could not handle relative path names in the configuration
   file, at least under OS/2.
 - Fix: Diskpoll forgot to poll mail for some AKAs if the downlink did not
   have the same number of akas as the uplink.
 - Fix: Diskpoll was not releasing file search handles, which could lead to 
   diskpoll not "seeing" some files in the outbound. This did only occur on 
   very large outbound directories.

Diskpoll 0.1.2, Released 17 Nov 1998
 - New: If the binkley outbound contains a reference to a file that
   does not exist, the reference is removed from the flowfile. This
   matches the behaviour that e.g. Binkley uses. (However, if the path
   in the reference does not exist as well, it is NOT removed to
   avoid removing all files from all flowfiles when the network path
   translation  is misconfigured or something).
 - New command line parameters: -s <flavour> and -r <flavour> specify the
   flavour of the files to send or receive. <flavour> is a string consisting
   of the letters "c", "i", "h", "d" and/or "n". If the -s and/or -r options
   are omitted, their parameters default to "?", which means "any flavour".
   These options do of course only work with a binkley outbound.
 - Fixed a bug in environment variable detection (%% was not replaced by a
   single percent character)
 - Added support for Windows NT using RSXNT.
 - Added support for DOS (DPMI required) using DJGPP.

Diskpoll 0.1.1, Released 05 Jul 1998
 - *.?UT packets are now renamed to *.PKT when they are copied to an
   inbound directory
